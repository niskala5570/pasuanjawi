A small project in an effort to dignify [Jawi][wikijawi] and Malay Arabic script.
Starting in 2.872, the [Pegon][wikipegon] and its family will also try to be supported so as not to be lost to time.

Hopefully this project makes it a little easier for designers from adding the dots manually themselves and hopefully may also become a reference for
type designers who are interested in adding Jawi-Pegon characters to their fonts.
